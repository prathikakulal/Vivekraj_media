          <p>
            Vivek Raj Poojary, a name synonymous with innovation and success,
            has carved a niche for himself in both the business and political
            arenas. Today, he is embarking on a groundbreaking venture that
            promises to revolutionize the agriculture industry: Indoor
            high-quality saffron farming using hydroponics. This ambitious
            project is set to redefine the standards of saffron cultivation,
            ensuring unmatched quality and consistent yield.

            <br /><br />

            <strong>Trailblazing Success in Business</strong><br />
            Vivek's illustrious career began in 2004 with a major iron ore
            excavation contract in Karnataka, marking his meteoric rise in
            business. His exceptional achievements earned him the Rajiv Gandhi
            Award in 2004 and the Indira Gandhi Award in 2005. In 2007, he was
            honored by the India Thai Chamber of Commerce, and in 2010, the
            World Economic Forum recognized him as the world's youngest CEO
            on the Global Growth Company platform at Davos, Switzerland.

            <span class="about-more">

              <br /><br />

              <strong>Global Expansion and Influence </strong> <br />
              Vivek's expertise led to an invitation from Zimbabwe's Deputy Prime
              Minister in 2012 to develop iron ore mines, and in 2014, he joined
              the World Economic Forum under the Confederation of Indian
              Industries, alongside industry titans like Mukesh Ambani and Anand
              Mahindra. In 2016, he ventured into farming, becoming one of India's
              largest spice growers and traders. His innovative approach extended
              to the U.S., where he established a significant agricultural
              presence. Vivek's vision of indoor farming for saffron and medicinal
              plants promises to eliminate crop losses and guarantee 100% revenue.

              <br /><br />

              <strong>Excellence in International Trade </strong> <br />
              Under Vivek's leadership, his company has expanded its trading
              portfolio to include organic fruits and vegetables sourced from
              around the world, with quality being the main agenda and principle.
              Contract farming initiatives in Spain, Africa, and various Asian
              countries have further solidified his global influence. The company
              trades in the best quality fruits, vegetables, meat, seafood, and
              cheese sourced from traditional makers worldwide, ensuring premium
              standards and customer satisfaction. Notably, the company is
              involved in salmon and tuna fishing and sources the best poultry
              meat from top suppliers, maintaining a commitment to excellence.
              Vivek's meticulous approach to trading ensures that only the finest
              products reach consumers. His company's network spans across
              continents, trading 35 different minerals from 72 countries and over
              190 varieties of vegetables and fruits worldwide. This vast and
              diverse network not only guarantees quality but also fosters
              international collaboration, bringing the best of global produce to
              the market. Vivek's dedication to quality and sustainability in
              trading is setting new benchmarks in the industry.

              <br /><br />

              <strong>Innovating the Future of Farming </strong> <br />
              Vivek's latest venture focuses on hydroponic cultivation of
              high-quality saffron indoors, ensuring optimal growth conditions and
              superior quality. Set to be among the largest indoor farming
              facilities by 2026, this project aims to revolutionize the spice
              industry. With the investments diversified in stocks,
              trading of minerals, and agricultural products trading, Vivek is
              well-prepared to lead this initiative. His company currently trades
              35 different minerals from 72 countries and 190-plus varieties of
              vegetables and fruits worldwide. This extensive network and
              experience in global trade provide a solid foundation for the
              success of his indoor saffron farming venture. Farming in the USA
              and expanding indoor farming of spices, saffron, and medicinal
              plants is a key focus for Vivek. By 2027, he aims to be a major
              player in the indoor farming of medicinal, spices, and exotic fruits
              and vegetables in the USA. His vision includes converting current
              outdoor farming practices to reliable indoor farming, where
              everything from weather to growth is under control, leading to a
              300% increase in profit. This forward-thinking approach is the
              future of farming, and Vivek seeks larger joint ventures to achieve
              this ambitious goal. Vivek's investment in hydroponic technology
              represents a leap towards sustainable agriculture. By controlling
              environmental factors, he ensures optimal growth conditions for
              saffron and other high-value crops. This method not only maximizes
              yield but also conserves water and reduces the need for pesticides,
              making it an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional
              farming. The potential to scale this model globally could transform
              agricultural practices and food security worldwide.

              <br /><br />

              <strong>Journey from Humble Beginnings </strong> <br />
              Vivek Raj Poojary's journey to global recognition is a true
              rags-to-riches story. Coming from a humble background, he faced
              numerous challenges but remained undeterred. His hard work,
              determination, and innovative mindset propelled him from local
              success to international acclaim. Vivek's story is an inspiration to
              countless young entrepreneurs who aspire to make a mark on the world
              stage.

              <br /><br />

              <strong>Commitment to Philanthropy </strong> <br />
              Beyond his business acumen, Vivek is dedicated to community
              upliftment. He supports farmers with advanced techniques, provides
              education for their children, and creates employment opportunities
              for locals through his business ventures. His charitable initiatives
              include organizing healthcare camps for underprivileged communities,
              improving farmers' yields and livelihoods, and opening educational
              opportunities for children to break the cycle of poverty. During the
              challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, Vivek's philanthropic
              efforts were particularly impactful. He distributed 25,000 kits to
              feed families of four for 20 days, provided thousands of chappals
              for laborers, covered lakhs of medical bills, and supplied thousands
              of COVID kits and medicines to laborers and their families in
              Mangalore and Chikmangalur. His initiatives also included buying
              vegetables from farmers to support them during the pandemic,
              ensuring their livelihoods were protected despite the risks
              involved. Vivek's empathy and proactive support for the community
              have been exemplary. His efforts to improve the lives of farmers
              have made a significant difference. By introducing advanced farming
              techniques and providing necessary resources, he has helped many
              farmers achieve better yields and improve their livelihoods. His
              charitable endeavors have touched thousands of lives, providing hope
              and opportunity where it was needed most.
              <br /><br />
              <strong> Passion for Antiques and Cultural Heritage </strong> <br />
              In addition to his business and philanthropic pursuits, Vivek is a
              passionate collector of fine antiques. He is the single biggest
              collector of LLADRO limited edition pieces in the world and owns an
              extensive collection of fine and expensive Montblanc pens. His
              collection includes the finest Persian mats dating back to the
              Persian era and rare artifacts procured through various auction
              houses around the world. Vivek plans to start his own auction house
              to hunt and find the finest antiques, which collectors can preserve
              and cherish. This venture is set to be ready in three months.
              Vivek's collection also features the finest Indian art and
              paintings, along with exquisite woodwork made from sandalwood,
              rosewood, and teak. He boasts collections of LLADRO, ERTE, RENE
              LALIQUE, MONTBLANC, and WATERFORD pieces, with the rarest limited
              edition items. His passion for preserving cultural
              heritage through these artifacts is not just a hobby but a mission
              to keep the rich history alive for future generations.



              <br /><br />

              <strong> Leadership and Political Impact </strong> <br />
              In recognition of his numerous achievements and significant
              contributions to business and society, Vivek Raj Poojary was
              appointed as the District Incharge of Chikkamagaluru, a picturesque
              hill station in Karnataka renowned for its coffee and agricultural
              heritage, by a prominent national political party. Supported by DK
              Shivakumar, whom Vivek regards as his leader, he was entrusted with
              the coordinator in-charge role for Chikkamagaluru. Vivek's strategic
              and financial capabilities were instrumental in ensuring victory in
              the assembly elections in the district. His efforts extended beyond
              his immediate responsibilities, encompassing other areas as well.
              Using their international data collection and strategy, they
              contributed significantly to the Congress party's success, engaging
              in door-to-door campaigns through WhatsApp and SMS. Vivek's
              leadership under DK Shivakumar and the Gandhi family is marked by
              his strategic vision, relentless pursuit of excellence, and
              unwavering commitment to ethical practices. His ability to foresee
              trends and adapt to changing market dynamics has positioned him as a
              forward-thinking leader in the global business community. As he
              continues to break new ground and inspire others, Vivek Raj
              Poojary's legacy is one of innovation, impact, and integrity.
